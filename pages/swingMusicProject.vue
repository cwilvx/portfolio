      <p>
        Swing music is a self-hosted music player and library manager built with
        both visual coolness and functionality in mind. It is based on the
        client-server architecture.

      <h2>‚≠êProject Objective and Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        I love music and I have a huge collection of music that I have collected
        over the years. I found it very hard to find and play the music that I
        wanted to listen to. The available music players were either too basic
        or too complicated. None of them was visually appealing to me either. I
        also needed smart playlists that would be generated based on my
        listening habits. Smart mixes based on a particular artist, album, genre
        were also on top of my list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding all these features in one app was very hard and using multiple
        apps for different features was not something I was willing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining all these features into one app was the main objective of this
        project. All the features of a typical music player, smart mixes and
        playlists based on my listening activity combined with a cool and easy
        to use interface was the main thing that I was going for.

      <h2>üõ†Web Stack and Explanation</h2>
      <p>The main stack of this project is Python, Flask, and Vue 3.</p>
      <p>
        This project has 2 parts, the backend and the frontend. The backend is
        written in Python. I decided to use Python because it was the language I
        was most comfortable with. I also wanted to learn more about Python and
        Flask.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend is written in Vue 3. I decided to use Vue 3 because it is a
        very performant framework and is easy to pickup as a web dev newbie.
