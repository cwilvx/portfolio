    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a software developer driven by a love for music and a desire to make
      an impact. My expertise is in JavaScript development, with a focus on the
      Vue framework, but I am equally comfortable working with any JavaScript
      framework. In my free time, I enjoy tackling optimization problems that
      challenge my problem-solving skills and expanding my skills as a hobby
      Python developer and tackling optimization problems that challenge my
      problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music has always played a big role in my life and I believe it has the
      power to connect people in unique ways. This love is reflected in my
      approach to software development where I aim to create solutions that are
      both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me cycling on the open road, exploring
      new routes and reveling in the freedom that comes with the wind in my
      hair. I view cycling as a way to clear my mind and recharge my batteries,
      and it has taught me the value of persistence, determination, and the
      importance of taking the time to enjoy the journey.
    </p>

      As a software developer, I am always seeking new solutions to complex
      problems and have a talent for breaking down complex ideas into simple
      components. I am a quick learner, always striving to stay up-to-date with
      the latest advancements in the industry. I am a strong team player and
      communicator, able to collaborate effectively with designers, developers,
      and stakeholders to bring projects to life.
