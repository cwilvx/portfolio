    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a software developer driven by a love for music and a desire to make
      an impact. My expertise is in JavaScript development, with a focus on the
      Vue framework, but I am equally comfortable working with any JavaScript
      framework. In my free time, I enjoy tackling optimization problems that
      challenge my problem-solving skills and expanding my skills as a hobby
      Python developer and tackling optimization problems that challenge my
      problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music has always played a big role in my life and I believe it has the
      power to connect people in unique ways. This love is reflected in my
      approach to software development where I aim to create solutions that are
      both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
