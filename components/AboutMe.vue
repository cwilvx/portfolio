    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>ðŸ›  This section is under construction! ðŸ› </p>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer with a crazy love for music. I wonder why I
      always find myself building music tools ðŸ¤”. Well, guess we'll never know.
      I have experience working with Python, Javascript and the ecosystem
      sorrounding the two.

      Outside tech, I'm generally a chill human. Kinda scared of people a lil
      bit, but will speak like we've been friends for life when engaged.

      Hobbies? Apart from sitting on my computer writing code and finding ways
      to make every aspect of my code faster, karaoke!
